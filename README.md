### Key Business Questions 
The funnel analysis and recommendations were made based on the following 5 key business questions:
1.	What steps of the funnel should we research and improve? Are there any specific drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride? 
2.	What part of our funnel has the lowest conversion rate? What can we do to improve this part of the funnel?
3.	Metrocar currently supports 3 different platforms: ios, android, and web. To recommend where to focus our marketing budget for the upcoming year, what insights can we make based on the platform?
4.	What age groups perform best at each stage of our funnel? Which age group(s) likely contain our target customers?
5.	Surge pricing is the practice of increasing the price of goods or services when there is the greatest demand for them. If we want to adopt a price-surging strategy, what does the distribution of ride requests look like throughout the day?
